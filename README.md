1. `apm install`
2. `apm link`

Open and atom and if it is already open then refresh. There will be a new command in the command
palette `CodeStream: Toggle`

If CodeStream throws an error about react-gravatar then go into the node_modules/react-gravatar
directory and run 'npm install' from there, then reload -Pez
